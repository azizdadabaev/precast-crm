## What this is

Beam-and-block flooring CRM for an Uzbek precast manufacturer. Operator-driven
workflow:

```
Calculator → Save Project (draft) → Place Order → In Production → Dispatched → Delivered
                                       ↑ creates Client + Order atomically
                                                                    ↑ assign driver + truck
                                                                                  ↑ photo + cash collected on site
                                                                                              ↓
                                                                                  Hand-over → Confirm (ADMIN/OWNER)
                                                                                  → paymentState becomes FULLY_PAID
```

Payment is **decoupled from order status** (no PAID status anymore). Order
status tracks production/delivery; `paymentState` (AWAITING_PAYMENT /
PARTIALLY_PAID / FULLY_PAID) tracks cash. See "Delivery & Cash Custody"
below.

Sidebar (UZ-primary):
**Бошқарув · Калькулятор · Лойиҳалар · Буюртмалар · Мижозлар · Ҳайдовчилар · Тўловлар · Тафовутлар**
(Drivers / Payments / Discrepancies are ADMIN/OWNER-only. Pipeline + Quotes are hidden from nav; Deal model still backs the data.)

## Setup on a fresh device

Prereqs: **Node 18+**, **Postgres 14+**, **git**.

```powershell
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/azizdadabaev/precast-crm.git
cd precast-crm\precast-crm   # NB: the Next.js project is the inner folder

# 2. Install deps
npm install

# 3. Make a local .env from the example, then edit DATABASE_URL with your Postgres password
copy .env.example .env
notepad .env   # set DATABASE_URL to postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASS@localhost:5432/precast_crm?schema=public
              # set JWT_SECRET to a 32+ char random string
              # ORDER_CANCEL_PASSWORD can stay as "etalontbm" or be changed

# 4. Create the database (one-time)
$env:PGPASSWORD = "YOUR_PASS"
& "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18\bin\psql.exe" -U postgres -h localhost -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE precast_crm"

# 5. Apply schema and seed demo data
npm run db:push        # push schema (no migration files; prototyping mode)
npm run db:seed        # admin@precast.local / admin123 (and 4 demo clients + 2 demo orders)

# 6. Run the dev server
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000
```

**Login:** `admin@precast.local` / `admin123`

If port 3000 is taken, Next will pick the next free port. The terminal output prints the URL.

## Quick walkthrough of the app

1. Open **http://localhost:3000/calculations** (the operator's home).
2. Type a client's **Name + Phone + Address** in the strip at the top. Phone has live autocomplete from the existing clients table.
3. Add rooms — each row computes live (Beam length, pitches, blocks/row, beams, slab area, subtotal).
4. **Save Project** (gray) — only phone is required. Stores a draft under `/projects`. Reopen any draft → opens the calculator pre-filled with the saved data.
5. **Буюртма Бериш · Place Order** (orange) — requires Name + Phone + Address + at least one valid room. Opens a modal with a capacity calendar:
   - Each day cell is colored by the m² already booked: green ≤ 300, yellow ≤ 450, orange ≤ 600, red > 600.
   - Past days are disabled.
   - Selected day previews the new order's m² impact.
6. Confirming creates everything in one transaction: Client (deduped by normalized phone), Deal advanced to WON, Project marked ORDERED, Order with frozen pricing snapshot, OrderEvent for the audit trail. You land on **/orders/[id]** with a fresh order number `YYYY-MM-NNNN`.
7. Status timeline on the order page: click pills to advance Placed → In Production → Delivered → Paid. Marking **Delivered** opens a modal that demands a **photo of the loaded truck** (JPG/PNG/WEBP, ≤8 MB). The image is stored under `public/uploads/orders/{orderId}/` and shown on both the order detail page and the printable invoice.
8. **/orders** page has the same capacity calendar at the top — clicking a day filters the list to that day.
9. Orders can be **canceled** by Admin (no password) or by anyone with the `ORDER_CANCEL_PASSWORD` env var (default `etalontbm`). Canceling frees the project back to Draft and moves the deal to LOST.
10. **Print** any order at `/orders/[id]/print` — auto-triggers `window.print()`. The page is a single A4-portrait sheet with: header, client + delivery (driver/truck if dispatched), a two-row-per-room table (primary scan-line + technical detail line for beam length, beams, blocks/row, total blocks, slab length, m² rate), totals strip, pricing breakdown, payment status, signature block, and a footer with a QR code that opens the order detail page on the operator dashboard. Fully-paid orders show a faint diagonal "PAID" watermark behind the rooms table. Brand strings (`PRECAST CRM`, tagline, phone) are hardcoded constants at the top of the print page — TODO: move to `AppConfig` once an admin-config UI exists. The delivery proof, if uploaded, still prints on its own page after the invoice.

## Calculation engine, in one paragraph

Three layout patterns: **Г-Б** (alternating), **Б-Г-Б** (extra closing beam),
**Г-Б-Г** (extra closing block row). Pitch = 0.58 m. Beam length = inner_width
+ 2 × bearing (default 0.15). Blocks per row = CEIL(inner_width / 0.20).

Auto-pick rule (post-correction remainder R = effective_length − pitches × PITCH):
R = 0 → GB; R ≤ 0.20 → BGB; R ≤ 0.45 → GBG; R > 0.45 → GB at pitches+1.

"Add a starting beam" (StartB toggle OR first manual extra beam): GB → BGB
at same pitches; **GBG → GB at pitches+1** (the extra block row is balanced
by the new beam, so the slab is now alternating N+1 ↔ N+1).

Pricing tiers keyed by manufactured beam length (m² rate 140k–230k, per-m
extra beam 60k–120k, blocks 6k each). m² billed on `pitches × PITCH × beam_length`
ONLY — pattern extras (Б-Г-Б's extra beam, Г-Б-Г's extra blocks) and manual
extras are separate per-line items. **Pricing is frozen at Place Order time.**

42 vitest cases cover every pattern × extras combo. Phone helpers and order-number
allocator have their own tests (60 total).

## Inventory module

The factory's daily output flows through this module:
**Production log → InventoryItem stock → Order delivery (decrement) → Cancel (restock)**.

### Schema (4 new models, 1 new OrderEventType)

```prisma
enum InventoryKind          { BEAM  BLOCK }
enum StockMovementReason    { PRODUCTION  DELIVERY  MANUAL_ADJUSTMENT  CANCELLATION_RESTOCK }
enum OrderEventType + STOCK_WARNING

model InventoryItem        // one row per (kind, beamLength). BLOCK row has beamLength = NULL.
  kind, beamLength?, quantity, lowStockThreshold (default 10), updatedAt
  @@unique([kind, beamLength], name: "kind_beamLength")

model ProductionEntry      // a single shift / batch
  producedAt, recordedById, notes, lines[], movements[]

model ProductionLine       // one line per kind+length within an entry
  productionEntryId, kind, beamLength?, quantity

model StockMovement        // append-only audit ledger
  inventoryItemId, change (signed), resultingQuantity, reason,
  productionEntryId?, orderId?, actorId?, note?
```

### Decrement & restock rule (the only one that matters)

- **Decrement on DELIVERED only** — never on placement. Lives inside the
  same Prisma transaction that flips status. Two paths:
  - Canonical: `POST /api/orders/[id]/delivery-proof` (the truck-photo flow).
  - Safety net: `PATCH /api/orders/[id]` with `status: DELIVERED`
    (programmatic; UI doesn't use this path).
  Both invoke `decrementForDelivery` from `lib/inventory.ts` against the
  project's frozen calculation snapshot.

- **Negative stock is allowed** (factory may have unlogged production).
  The decrement still succeeds, a `STOCK_WARNING` OrderEvent is appended
  to the audit log per affected SKU, and the order detail page shows an
  amber banner pointing the operator at the Inventory page to reconcile.

- **Restock on cancellation only when `status` was `DELIVERED` or `PAID`**.
  PLACED / IN_PRODUCTION orders never decremented, so cancellation is a
  no-op for stock. Restock writes `CANCELLATION_RESTOCK` movements with
  the cancel reason in the note.

### Files of interest

- `lib/inventory.ts` — pure helpers (`canonicalBeamLength`,
  `calcSnapshotToInventoryLines`, `stockTier`) + DB ops
  (`applyStockMovement`, `decrementForDelivery`, `restockForCancellation`).
  The DB ops use `findFirst + create/update` rather than `upsert` because
  Prisma's composite-unique upsert is brittle on Decimal columns.
- `app/api/production/route.ts` — `GET ?days=14` and `POST` to create an
  entry with lines + stock movements in one transaction.
- `app/api/inventory/route.ts`, `[id]/route.ts`, `[id]/adjust/route.ts` —
  list, threshold update (admin), manual adjustment (admin + required note).
- `app/(app)/production/page.tsx` — log form + recent-14-day grouped list.
- `app/(app)/inventory/page.tsx` — summary cards + Beams/Blocks tables
  with tier coloring (red ≤ threshold, amber ≤ 1.5×, normal otherwise),
  inline threshold editor (admin), and an Adjust button per row (admin).
- `components/production/ProductionLogForm.tsx` — dynamic line list.
- `components/inventory/AdjustStockDialog.tsx` — delta + required note,
  shows projected resulting quantity.

### Tests

- 14 pure unit tests in `tests/inventory.test.ts` cover `canonicalBeamLength`,
  `calcSnapshotToInventoryLines` (collapse same-length beams, drop zero
  qty, blocks-only snapshot), `stockTier`, `formatInventoryLabel`.
- The full DB-touching cycle (production → delivery → restock) is currently
  **manual** in this PR. Prisma's number↔Decimal conversion in the test
  environment is too flaky to land reliably; left a `describe.skip` block
  with a TODO. The pure helpers it would have wrapped are already proven.

### Manual verification recipe

1. `Production` page: log "Beam 4.30m × 5", "Block × 200" → save.
   `Inventory`: two SKUs appear, +5 and +200 PRODUCTION movements.
2. Place + advance an order to DELIVERED via the truck-photo flow.
   `Inventory`: matching beam length and BLOCK row decrement; DELIVERY
   movements are appended to each.
3. Engineer the demand to exceed stock (or short the production log).
   Delivery still completes; an amber banner appears on the order detail
   page; `STOCK_WARNING` events are in the activity log.
4. Cancel the delivered order with the password (`etalontbm`):
   `CANCELLATION_RESTOCK` movements appear, quantities return to where
   they were before the delivery.
5. Cancel a PLACED order: no stock movements written.
6. Manual adjust (admin only) on the inventory page: dialog requires a
   note, projected qty preview shows; submitting writes a
   `MANUAL_ADJUSTMENT` movement.

## Contact export (multi-select share) module

Operators frequently need to give a new prospect the contact info of past
clients in nearby regions, so the prospect can visit a finished slab and
see how it performs in real life. Today that's a one-click export from
the Clients page.

### Privacy gate (always enforced)

A client is only includable in an export when their `referenceConsent`
is `GRANTED`. The state has three values:

```prisma
enum ReferenceConsent { NOT_ASKED  GRANTED  DENIED }
```

- **NOT_ASKED** — default for every existing and new client. No export.
- **GRANTED** — operator explicitly recorded the client's consent. Export OK.
- **DENIED** — operator recorded a refusal. Treated identically to
  NOT_ASKED for export purposes; the difference matters only as audit.

The gate is enforced **server-side** in `POST /api/clients/export` —
even if the UI sends an ID list that includes non-consenting clients,
the server filters them out before formatting. The dialog warns when
some IDs were dropped: "2 clients excluded (no consent on file)".

### Format

`lib/contact-export.ts` is the pure formatter. Exact format rules
(snapshot-tested in `tests/contact-export.test.ts`):

```
Aliyev Construction
+998 90 111 22 33
Tashkent, Yashnobod district

Karimov LLC
+998 93 555 44 66
Samarkand, Registan st. 12

BuildPro Group
+998 77 123 45 67
(address not on file)
```

- Phone formatted via `lib/phone.ts` `formatPhone` (`+998 XX XXX XX XX`).
- Missing/empty/whitespace-only address → literal `(address not on file)`.
- Blocks separated by exactly one blank line; trailing whitespace stripped.
- Whitespace WITHIN a name or address is preserved as-is.

### Audit trail

```prisma
model ExportEvent {
  id         String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId     String
  clientIds  String[]    // Postgres text[]
  exportedAt DateTime @default(now())
  user       User     @relation(...)
}
```

One row per call to `POST /api/clients/export`. Captures who handed out
which contacts when. The `userId` FK is verified against the User table
before insert (defense against stale JWTs after a schema reset — same
pattern as the cancel route).

### UI surfaces

- `/clients` — leftmost checkbox column. Rows with consent ≠ GRANTED
  show a disabled checkbox with a `title` of "Розилик берилмаган · No
  consent on file". A "Select all (filtered)" header checkbox toggles
  only the visible eligible rows. Selection state lives in a
  `Set<string>` and is **cleared whenever filters change** (operators
  re-confirm context after re-querying).
- Sticky action bar above the table when ≥ 1 row is selected:
  "Selected: N · Export Contacts · Clear".
- `ExportDialog` (`components/clients/ExportDialog.tsx`) — fetches
  the formatted text from the server, shows it in an editable textarea
  (operators sometimes prune lines), 1-click "Copy to clipboard" with a
  2-second "✓ Copied" confirmation state.
- `/clients/[id]` — new "Reference Consent" card. Badge shows current
  state (green/red/gray); "Update consent" opens `ConsentDialog` with a
  radio group + optional note. Saves PATCH the client and stamp
  `consentUpdatedAt`.

### Validation gates

- `ContactExportSchema` caps the IDs array at **50** to prevent
  accidental "export everyone" via a buggy script.
- The endpoint **requires authentication**. A stale JWT (user no longer
  in DB) returns 401 with a "log out and back in" hint.

### What's intentionally out of scope

- No SMS/WhatsApp **sending** — operators paste into their messenger of
  choice. The text format is the contract; sending is a separate PR.
- No "Export All" button — every export is an explicit, scoped action.
- No consent column on the main clients table — internal privacy
  field, lives only on the detail page.
- No bulk delete / bulk edit / bulk anything else.

## Delivery & Cash Custody module

This is the dominant flow in the system. Cash is collected at the delivery
site by the driver, then handed to the operator at the office, then
confirmed by the owner. Each step is timestamped with the verified actor
ID — the chain of custody IS the audit trail.

### Why this shape

The previous model gated production behind payment. Real-world Uzbekistan
flow is the opposite: customer places order → factory produces → driver
delivers and collects cash on the spot → operator records it → owner
confirms it. The schema mirrors that flow exactly so each handoff is
attributable.

### Schema (3 new models, 1 new field on Order, 1 new enum)

```prisma
enum OrderStatus           { DRAFT  PLACED  IN_PRODUCTION  DISPATCHED  DELIVERED  CANCELED }
                           // PAID is gone — paid-ness moved to paymentState
enum OrderPaymentState     { AWAITING_PAYMENT  PARTIALLY_PAID  FULLY_PAID }
enum PaymentStatus         { PENDING_CONFIRMATION  CONFIRMED  REJECTED }
enum PaymentMethod         { CASH  BANK_TRANSFER  CLICK  PAYME  OTHER }
enum DiscrepancyStatus     { OPEN  RESOLVED_RECOVERED  RESOLVED_DISCOUNT  RESOLVED_WRITEOFF  DISPUTED }
enum UserRole              + OPERATOR, OWNER

model Driver
  name, phone @unique, active (default true), notes?
  dispatches[], collectedPayments[]

model Dispatch              // 1:0..1 with Order (orderId @unique for v1)
  orderId @unique, driverId, dispatchedById?, truckIdentifier?,
  expectedCollection (Decimal), notes?, dispatchedAt, returnedAt?

model Payment
  orderId, amount (Decimal), method, status (default PENDING_CONFIRMATION),
  collectedById?, collectedAt?,                  // driver step
  recordedById, recordedAt,                       // operator step
  handedOverToOfficeById?, handedOverAt?,         // operator hand-over step
  confirmedById?, confirmedAt?, adjustmentNote?,  // owner confirm step
  rejectedById?, rejectedAt?, rejectionReason?,
  note?
  // 4 timestamps + 4 actor FKs = chain of custody

model Discrepancy
  orderId, paymentId?, driverId?, expectedAmount, receivedAmount, shortfall,
  status (default OPEN), reportedById?, reportedAt,
  resolvedById?, resolvedAt?, resolutionNote?
```

`Order` gained `paymentState` and `confirmedPaid` (a denormalized sum of
CONFIRMED Payment.amount, recomputed inside the confirm transaction).

### Maker-checker (the core invariant)

- **Maker** (any authenticated role): records the payment, records the
  hand-over to the office.
- **Checker** (ADMIN or OWNER only — `canConfirmCash()` in `lib/auth.ts`):
  confirms or rejects payments, resolves discrepancies.

The same actor cannot both record AND confirm in the happy path; the
client UI omits the confirm action for non-checkers, and the API gates
return 403. Confirm/reject endpoints accept ADMIN as a superuser by
convention even though the spec names OWNER as the operational role.

### Three entry points for recording payments

Customers don't pay at one moment — partials are common, transfers
arrive between placement and delivery, drivers collect cash on site.
All three paths converge on the same `Payment` row shape with status
`PENDING_CONFIRMATION`; the owner confirms from `/payments`. The only
difference is which chain-of-custody fields get stamped:

| Entry point | Source | `collectedById` | `collectedAt` | `handedOverToOfficeAt` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Place Order dialog** (Тўлов field) | `IN_OFFICE_CASH` | null | null | null |
| **Add Payment dialog** on order detail (mid-order) | `IN_OFFICE_CASH` or `BANK_OR_ONLINE` | null | null | set iff `handOverNow` & cash |
| **Delivery Proof dialog** (cash collected on site) | `FROM_DRIVER_AT_DELIVERY` | dispatch.driverId | now | null (operator hand-over later) |

The placement dialog and Add Payment dialog both go through `POST /api/payments`
with the appropriate `source`. The delivery flow inlines the Payment
creation in `delivery-proof/route.ts` so it can stay atomic with the
order flip and inventory decrement, but the row shape matches.

`/api/payments` rejects when `amount > totalPrice − confirmedPaid −
sum(PENDING)` so we can't double-record while a previous payment is
still in the owner's queue. It also rejects on CANCELED orders and on
DELIVERED + FULLY_PAID orders.

`ChainOfCustodyPanel` renders different step lists per shape: 3 steps
for the driver path, 2 for in-office cash (recorded → handed over to
owner), 1 for bank/online (no physical handover step at all).

### Lifecycle, end to end

1. **Place order** — same as before. `paymentState = AWAITING_PAYMENT`,
   no Dispatch yet.
2. **Production** — operator advances PLACED → IN_PRODUCTION. Inventory
   is *not* decremented yet (still happens at DELIVERED).
3. **Dispatch** — operator clicks the DISPATCHED step on the order page,
   picks a driver from the active list and a truck identifier, sets
   `expectedCollection` (defaults to outstanding balance). Creates a
   Dispatch row, flips the order to DISPATCHED, appends a `DISPATCHED`
   OrderEvent.
4. **Delivery + cash collection** — operator clicks DELIVERED, the
   `DeliveryProofDialog` opens with truck-photo upload AND a cash
   collection panel pre-filled from `dispatch.expectedCollection`. The
   operator records what the driver actually brought back; if nothing,
   they tick "no cash collected" and write a reason. On submit, the
   route:
   - validates + saves the photo
   - decrements inventory inside the same transaction
   - creates a Payment row (status=PENDING_CONFIRMATION,
     collectedById=dispatch.driverId, recordedById=current user)
   - if `driverReturned` was checked, stamps `dispatch.returnedAt`
   - flips order to DELIVERED
   - appends `DELIVERED` and `PAYMENT_RECORDED` OrderEvents
5. **Hand-over to office** — operator goes back later and clicks
   "Hand over" on the payment row. Stamps
   `handedOverToOfficeById/At`. If the dispatch hasn't been marked
   returned yet, that route also stamps `returnedAt`.
6. **Confirm or reject** — owner opens `/payments` (Pending tab),
   sees the chain of custody. Confirms-as-recorded for the happy path.
   If the owner adjusts the amount, an adjustmentNote is required. If
   the recorded amount is below `dispatch.expectedCollection`, a
   DiscrepancyChoice (TRACK / DISCOUNT / WRITEOFF) + 5-char min note are
   required. Confirm:
   - sets `payment.status = CONFIRMED`, stamps `confirmedById/At`
   - recomputes `order.confirmedPaid = SUM(CONFIRMED amounts)`
   - sets `order.paymentState = FULLY_PAID` if `confirmedPaid >= totalPrice`,
     `PARTIALLY_PAID` if > 0, else `AWAITING_PAYMENT`
   - stamps `order.paidAt` only when transitioning to FULLY_PAID
   - if shortfall: creates a Discrepancy with status
     OPEN / RESOLVED_DISCOUNT / RESOLVED_WRITEOFF based on the action
   - appends `PAYMENT_CONFIRMED` (and `DISCREPANCY_OPENED` when applicable)
7. **Reject** — owner provides a 3-char min reason. Sets status=REJECTED,
   stamps rejected actor + timestamp. Does NOT add to confirmedPaid.

### Files of interest

- `lib/auth.ts` — `AuthRole` now includes OPERATOR + OWNER. `canConfirmCash()`
  is the maker-checker gate.
- `lib/validation.ts` — `PaymentRecordSchema`, `PaymentConfirmSchema`,
  `PaymentRejectSchema`, `DriverCreateSchema`, `DispatchCreateSchema`,
  `DiscrepancyUpdateSchema`. Added `OrderPaymentStateEnum`,
  `PaymentMethodEnum`, `DiscrepancyStatusEnum`.
- `app/api/orders/[id]/dispatch/route.ts` — POST creates Dispatch + flips
  to DISPATCHED.
- `app/api/dispatches/[id]/return/route.ts` — POST stamps `returnedAt`.
  Idempotent.
- `app/api/orders/[id]/delivery-proof/route.ts` — multipart with
  cashAmount, noCashCollected, noCashCollectedNote, driverReturned.
  Creates the Payment row with collected-by = dispatch driver.
- `app/api/payments/route.ts` — GET (filterable by orderId, status) /
  POST (record). All routes return the full custody chain via Prisma includes.
- `app/api/payments/[id]/handover/route.ts` — operator step, any role.
- `app/api/payments/[id]/confirm/route.ts` — checker only; recomputes
  `confirmedPaid` and `paymentState`, opens Discrepancies as needed.
- `app/api/payments/[id]/reject/route.ts` — checker only; required reason.
- `app/api/drivers/*` — list with augmented counts
  (activeDispatchCount, discrepancyCount30d, lastDispatchAt), CRUD,
  ADMIN/OWNER deactivate.
- `app/api/discrepancies/*` — ADMIN/OWNER list + status PATCH with note.
- `app/api/dashboard/route.ts` — revenue counts CONFIRMED Payments only;
  added `cashOnRoad` (SUM expectedCollection where returnedAt=null) and
  `openDiscrepancies` (count of OPEN rows).

### UI surfaces

- `/orders` — added "Dispatched" filter tab and a Payment column with
  `paymentState` badge per row.
- `/orders/[id]` — DISPATCHED step in the timeline triggers
  `DispatchDialog`; DELIVERED step triggers the extended
  `DeliveryProofDialog`. Below the breakdown grid: a Dispatch info panel
  (driver + truck + expected + Mark Returned button) and a Payments table
  (chain of custody with per-row Hand over action).
- `/drivers` — list with active/inactive toggle (ADMIN/OWNER), opens
  `DriverFormDialog`. `/drivers/[id]` shows recent dispatches + 30d
  discrepancies.
- `/payments` — checker queue. Tabs Pending / Confirmed / Rejected;
  `ConfirmPaymentDialog` wraps `ChainOfCustodyPanel` + adjustment input
  + `DiscrepancyChoice`. ADMIN/OWNER only.
- `/discrepancies` — Open / Resolved / Disputed tabs; each row opens
  `DiscrepancyUpdateDialog`. ADMIN/OWNER only.
- Dashboard — added "Cash on the road" and "Open discrepancies" KPI
  cards. Revenue tile relabelled "Revenue (confirmed)" and now sums only
  CONFIRMED Payment.amount.

### Tests

- `tests/dispatch-and-cash-flow.test.ts` — 24 unit cases: schema
  validation for the new endpoints, role-gate behaviour for
  `canConfirmCash`, paymentState computation rule, enum shape (DISPATCHED
  present, PAID absent).
- DB-touching integration tests (production gate removed, dispatch
  transition, delivery+collection, hand-over, audit log, computed-field
  correctness) are not landed: this repo doesn't have a DB harness yet.
  Worth adding alongside the inventory `describe.skip` block once we
  stand up a test database.

### Manual verification recipe

1. Place an order and advance it to IN_PRODUCTION as before.
2. From the order page, click **Dispatched**. Pick a driver + truck +
   expected collection (defaults to outstanding). Order flips to
   DISPATCHED; the Dispatch panel appears below the breakdown grid.
3. Click **Delivered**. Upload a truck photo, confirm/edit the cash
   amount, optionally tick "Driver returned to office". Submit. Order
   flips to DELIVERED, inventory decrements, a PENDING payment row
   appears in the Payments table.
4. Click **Hand over** on the payment row (or skip — already stamped if
   the driver-returned checkbox was used).
5. Log in as ADMIN/OWNER (admin@precast.local). Open `/payments`. The
   payment is in Pending. Open the dialog: chain of custody has 3
   green steps. Confirm-as-recorded on the happy path. The dashboard's
   Revenue tile updates.
6. To exercise discrepancies: in step 3 enter an amount < expected.
   In step 5, the dialog shows the DiscrepancyChoice. Pick TRACK with a
   note → a row appears in `/discrepancies`. Resolve it via the
   dialog with a 5+ char note.
7. Cancel a DELIVERED order (admin or password) — inventory restocks
   as before; existing payments are NOT auto-rejected (owner has to
   reject them manually if appropriate).

### Outstanding items / known limits

- `Dispatch.orderId` is `@unique` for v1, so an order has at most one
  dispatch. Re-dispatch (truck breakdown, driver swap) requires a schema
  change to make this 1:N.
- Cancel does NOT cascade to existing CONFIRMED payments. If an order
  is canceled after the customer paid, the owner has to manually
  reconcile (refund + reject the payment).
- Existing ADMIN-only API gates that were NOT broadened to OWNER in
  this PR (out of scope; flagged for a follow-up):
  - `app/api/inventory/[id]/route.ts:12` — PATCH lowStockThreshold
  - `app/api/inventory/[id]/adjust/route.ts:19` — manual stock adjust
  - `app/api/orders/[id]/cancel/route.ts:28` — order cancellation
    (also accepts the company `ORDER_CANCEL_PASSWORD` fallback)
  - `app/(app)/inventory/page.tsx:58` — UI gate on inline threshold
    edit + Adjust button (cosmetic; the API already enforces)
  Spec wanted these flagged, not changed.

## What's NOT implemented yet (deferred)

Items 5, 11, 12, 14 from the 14 best-practices list:
- **Recent calcs rail** at the top of /calculations
- **Role gates** beyond cancel — currently anyone authenticated can save & order;
  ENGINEER/SALES/ADMIN distinctions only enforce cancel
- **Per-role discount caps** (5% / 15% / unlimited)
- **Enter-key adds row** in the calculator

## Keys facts to remember when you keep building

- The Pipeline page (`/pipeline`) and route still exist; only the sidebar nav was hidden. Deal model is intact and used by the Order placement transaction (it advances Deal to WON).
- Phones are stored **digits-only** in the DB (`998901112233`) and formatted on display (`+998 90 111 22 33`). Search supports last-4-digits.
- `Quote` model was renamed to `Order`. The `/api/quotes/*` and `/quotes/*` routes were deleted.
- `Client.location` was renamed to `Client.address`.
- `Project.dealId` is **nullable** now; drafts can exist before a Deal.
- Schema migrations use `prisma db push` (no migrations folder). For a fresh clone, `npm run db:push` is enough; for an existing DB with old data, `npm run db:push --force-reset` will drop everything and start over (seed data is regenerable).
- `public/uploads/` is gitignored. Delivery photos live there per machine.
- Memory files for Claude Code live under `~/.claude/projects/c--Users-…/memory/` per machine and **do not** sync via git. Re-create on the new device by saying "remember the calculation patterns / pricing tiers" once or letting Claude rediscover them from the code.
